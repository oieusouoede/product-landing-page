# freeCodeCamp challenge: Product Landing Page
Another day another project. This is my solution for the product landing page challenge so I can get that freeCodeCamp certificaton. The code is quite a mess, I think I can make it look way more organized but at least I could experiment with some cute animations. Its a follow up on the used UFO shop theme. Maybe I can make a fully functioning website out of it someday in the future but this is it for now. Two more challenges to go.

It is hosted [here](https://codepen.io/edesoares/full/WNjBRdy).

Be safe y'all,\
